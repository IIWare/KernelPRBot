KernelPRBot
===========

This repository contains the message template that we use with
KernelPRBot, our bot that replies to people who mistakenly open pull
requests on the read-only GitHub mirror of the Linux kernel.

You can find the script we use to run the bot over at
https://github.com/ajdlinux/PRBot.

Contributions are welcome - if you think there's some useful
information we've forgotten, or some part of the text that's unclear,
please submit an issue or pull request! Translations of the message
text are also welcome.

If you have any further questions about KernelPRBot, please feel free
to contact its owners, @ajdlinux and @daxtens.
